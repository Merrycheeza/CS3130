Problem:  	Using the code in files udp_remote.py and udp_local.py write a
		messaging system. 

Needs:		user database
		message database for each user
		functions script file
		main script file

Functions:	
    logIn
		logOut
		whoIsOn
		send
		help
		
Scenario1:	
    user1 logs in as client
		server welcomes user1
		server checks for messages and finds none
		user1 checks to see if user2 is online
		server informs user1 that user2 is not available
		user1 sends user2 mail
		user1 logs off
-- This scenario works perfectly in the program, there aren't any problems with it. 

Scenario2:	
    user1 logs in as client
		server welcomes user1
		user2 logs in as client
		server welcomes user2
		user1 checks to see if user2 is online
		server informs user1 that user2 is available
		user1 sends user2 message
		server delivers message to user2
		user2 receives message
		user2 sends user1 message
		server delivers message to user1
		user1 logs off
		user2 logs off
-- This scenario isn't working very well. user1 and user2 can send each other messages but must log in and out to receive them which is a bit bothersome. With a little time I could figure out the bugs and how to fix them but with time constraints, I didn't want to push the envelope too far with it.

Scenario3:	
    user2 logs in as client
		server welcomes user2
		server alerts client to messages
		server delivers mail
		user2 logs off
-- This scenario also works perfectly. Message retrieval is quick and I overcame the problem of deleted messages.
